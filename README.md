# C# library for Stockfighter REST API

## TODO:

1. Create simple C# library to support at least the next REST methods from "Trading API Reference" (see https://starfighter.readme.io/v1.0/docs):

    * GET: Check The API Is Up
    * GET: Stocks on a Venue
    * POST: A New Order For A Stock
    * DELETE: Cancel An Order

2. Describe how to use your library (README.md).
3. Create console app to show your library in action. It may be something like this: https://asciinema.org/a/7m6x8s6p0b3assq4gxyttk70u
4. Augment repo with files that are commonly used in open-source repositories (like CONTRIBUTING.md, LICENSE.md etc.). You may add appropriate .gitignore as well.
5. Create pull request from your branch to master.
